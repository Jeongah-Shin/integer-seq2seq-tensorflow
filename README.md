### Settings

For activate the virtual environment for testing model,

```bash
source ./arie-tf-2.0/bin/activate
```

***or***

For your custom virtual environment,

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```



### TODO 

- [x] virtual environment settings for implementing tensorflow 2.0
- [x] pylint settings for IDE
  - reference : https://code-examples.net/en/q/245e146
- [ ] problem definition 
- [ ] EDA
- [ ] experiment design
  - [ ] baselines
  - [ ] models
  - [ ] data exploration results
- [ ] cost function / optimizer selection
- [ ] train model
	- [ ] data feeding - batch size
	- [ ] optimization solver - training epoch, learning rate
- [ ] evaluation metrics
- [ ] experimental results



### Challenges
